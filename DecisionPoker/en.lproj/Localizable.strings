"Here are all the colors of the rainbow. We chose this as an example deck to show how to use this app. You can change the name of the deck if you want. If you (or your team) have a project that requires several colors, and you are not sure about which ones you want to use, let the app do the picking for you! In the default setup, your device will randomly choose 3 out of 7 colors. Add, delete, or deselect colors as you wish by pressing the \"Card List\" button. Change the number of choices using the stepper on the screen. Feel free to add additional comments about your deck here! If this is the topic you want to use to make a decision, hit the \"Deal!\" button above. If you would like to make a new deck, press the \"+\" button below and edit the deck as you would this one.

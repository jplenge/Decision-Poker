# Decision Poker

This app is intended to help you making a decision an enjoyable process. It likens the process to a game of poker. 

I use this app to improve my skills in Swift and SwiftUI. The idea for this app came about when my wife and I decided to learn how to write iOS apps with Swift. You can find the Decision Poker app  on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/decision-poker/id1472948427?l=en-US).
